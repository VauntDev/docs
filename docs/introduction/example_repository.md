The Example repo provides a basic set of free achievements, ideal for initial testing, or projects that are just getting started. Also, we have a quick onboarding guildline in the repo. On the other hand, the TQLA repo have more advanced achievements to drive and foster community engagement. Learn how to set up achievements **[here](https://github.com/VauntDev/docs/blob/simon-docs/docs/organizations/achievements.md)**.
