Vaunt can currently be installed as a GitHub Application. We will be adding more installation targets as we begin supporting more platforms with Vaunt.

You can find our application [here](https://github.com/marketplace/vaunt-dev). We will also be publishing a Market Place listing in the near future to make it easier to find Vaunt, and stay up to date on our development updates.
