# Overview

Vaunt is a developer relations platform that is designed to help developers connect, collaborate, and share experiences with each other.  

Vaunt is designed for two primary audiences:

* **Developers**: Vaunt provides developers with the ability to showcase their contributions to open-source projects.

* **Organizations/Repo Owners**: Vaunt provides organizations/repo owners with tools to help drive user contributions to their product and helps gamify the creation of developer communities.

Open-source technology is built around the core principles of transparency, collaboration, and community-driven innovation. These principles allow developers and product users to collaborate and contribute to a project and enable them to further develop the product to suit their specific needs.

Establishing a community that contributes back to the project, over time, often results in the following benefits:

* **Increased innovation**: Open-source developer communities encourage collaboration and allow for contributions from a diverse range of developers. This results in more innovative and cutting-edge solutions.

* **Faster development**: With a community of developers working on a project, development can progress at a faster pace. Developers can share knowledge and expertise, identify and fix issues more quickly, and help each other overcome obstacles.

* **Broader adoption**: Open-source projects often have a wider user base due to their accessibility and low cost. This can lead to more widespread adoption and use of the technology.

* **Improved quality**: Open-source communities often have a rigorous review process for contributions, which can lead to higher-quality code and fewer bugs.

* **Increased visibility**: Building an open-source community can help to promote a project and increase its visibility. This can lead to more partnerships, funding opportunities, and community engagement.

* **Sustainability**: Open-source projects can be more sustainable in the long term, as they are less reliant on a single organization or individual for development and maintenance. The community can continue to support and enhance the project even if the original creators move on.

We believe collaboration is at the core of building a strong open-source community. Open-source projects thrive on collaboration, and as such, it is crucial to foster an environment that encourages it.

# Problems We Solve 
Vaunt helps solve the following problems

* **Visiblity**: Open source contributions are typically overlooked. In larger organizations, this can be an easily overlooked metric for engineering satisfaction and velocity.

* **Incentivization**: Developers have little incentive to contribute to open-source code. Outside of monetary incentives, there are no incentive mechanisms that organizations can apply to grow their developer communities through their existing code bases.

* **Maintaining Projects** Open source technology generally gets more utilization. This utilization typically results in large amounts of feature requests or bug escalations. The effort to keep up with these requests increases as the project becomes more widely adopted. Leverage a developer community is crucial to the project's success and longevity.
