GitHub provides users with the ability to customize their profile pages by creating a profile readme file. You can learn more about managing your GitHub readme [here](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).

In short, the readme file is a simple markdown file that can be used to describe yourself. GitHub has a wide range of support for markdown features and if you are new to markdown, you can find an introduction from GitHub [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

We have taken advantage of this awesome Github feature by leveraging the basic HTML support provided to embed our Developer Cards.

Once you have created a user repository with a readme file, simply add the following lines and replace github_username with your username.

```html
<p>
    <a href="https://vaunt.dev">
        <img src="https://api.vaunt.dev/v1/github/entities/{{github_username}}/contributions?format=svg" width="350" title="Includes public contributions"/>
    </a>
</p>
```

Optionally, you can include private repositories by passing `private=true` as a query parameter

Here is an updated example **including** private contributions.

```html
<p>
    <a href="https://vaunt.dev">
        <img src="https://api.vaunt.dev/v1/github/entities/{{github_username}}/contributions?format=svg&private=true" width="350" title="Includes public and private contributions" />
    </a>
</p>
```

That's it!
