GitHub provides users with the ability to customize their profile pages by creating a profile readme file. You can learn more about managing your GitHub readme [here](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).

In short, the readme file is a simple markdown file that can be used to describe yourself. GitHub has a wide range of support for markdown features and if you are new to markdown, you can find an introduction from GitHub [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

We have taken advantage of this awesome Github feature by leveraging the basic HTML support provided to embed our Developer Cards. This is how one of [the Vaunt team members](https://github.com/simonmazzaroth) utilized the solution found in his personal README.
